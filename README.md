Paper Abstract:

peciation is often viewed as a continuum along which populations diverge until they become reproductively-isolated species. However, such divergence may be heterogeneous, proceeding in fits and bursts, rather than being uniform and gradual. We show in *Timema* stick insects that one component of reproductive isolation evolves non-uniformly across this continuum, whereas another does not. Specifically, we use thousands of host-preference and mating trials to study habitat and sexual isolation among 42 pairs of taxa spanning a range of genomic differentiation and divergence time. We find that habitat isolation is uncoupled from genomic differentiation within species, but accumulates linearly with it between species. In contrast, sexual isolation accumulates linearly across the speciation continuum, and thus exhibits similar dynamics to morphological traits not implicated in reproductive isolation. The results show different dynamics for different components of reproductive isolation, and highlight a special relevance for species status in the evolution of reproductive isolation.
